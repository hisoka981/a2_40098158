                <h4>Here are some useful tips for a first-time dog owner</h4>
                <p>1) It is easier to train dogs earlier than later. We either recommend
                    hiring a dog trainer for this or looking up some resources
                    online to do it yourself.
                </p>
                <p>2) Different dog breeds require different levels of activity. It is
                    important to figure this out early on, and we recommend finding for
                    online forums for this, or ask one of our employees at the shelter.
                </p>
                <p>3) Unlike cats, dogs aren't too great at cleaning themselves so
                    we recommend the ocassional showers, however the frequency
                    depends on the breed.
                </p>
                <p>4) Lots of dogs require daily walks but besides this, it is also
                    important for some dogs to socialize with other dogs. This is
                    highly dependent on the breed so we recommend either asking one
                    of our employees or look for some resources online.
                </p>
                <p>5) If you are a first-time dog owner, do not hesitate to ask
                    questions. We at Luigi's shelter are here to help!
