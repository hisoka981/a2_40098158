                <h3>Luigi's Cat And Dog Shelter Has Been Operating Since 2010</h3>
                <p>Luigi, the owner of this shelter, has been taking care of
                    cats and dogs from his home for decades. Luigi has nursed and taken
                    care of dozens of cats and dogs, however, he recently found
                    himself being spread too thin so he decided to open a shelter
                    which is now located at 3438 Crescent street.
                </p>
                <p>Luigi's shelter opened up during the summer of 2010, and since then
                    the shelter has seen over 100 dogs and cats.
                </p>
