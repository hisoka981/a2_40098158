                <h4>Here are some useful tips for a first-time cat owner</h4>
                <p>1) Cats don't require training in the same way dogs do, however,
                    you can do some training if your cat is too aggressive. We recommend
                    either hiring a cat trainer or looking up online resources for this.
                </p>
                <p>2) There are house cats and wild cats. The type of cat you should get
                    depends on where you are located. If there are no natural cat 
                    predators or any hazards around your home, then a wild cat
                    can work but you should ask one of workers about this.
                </p>
                <p>3) Cats can groom/clean themselves so you don't have to clean them. 
                    You can trim your cats hair, however, and this could be done using
                    tools or hiring a professional cat hair trimmer.
                </p>
                <p>4) If you have lots of valuables in your home out in the open, 
                    you should watch out because lots of cats are active and jumpy.
                </p>
                <p>5) If you are a first-time dog owner, do not hesitate to ask
                    questions. We at Luigi's shelter are here to help!
